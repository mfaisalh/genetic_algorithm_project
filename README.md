# Genetic Algorithm with Machine Learning Integration

## Overview

This project implements a Genetic Algorithm (GA) with enhancements using Machine Learning (ML) to predict fitness values and improve search efficiency. The GA is designed to solve optimization problems using DEAP, a Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms in Python framework.

## Features

- Adaptive mutation and crossover rates
- Hybrid local search
- Integration with Machine Learning for fitness prediction
- Logging and checkpoints
- Visualization of fitness over generations

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/genetic_algorithm_project.git
